Fuel price conversion

This page allows the user to compare fuel prices regardless of measurement system and currency. It facilitates comparison between gas prices at the pump in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, you are an American visiting Paris and the price for gas is 1.49 EUR/L. You wonder if that is high or low. Your unit cancellation skills from chemistry class have gotten a bit rusty and you can't just punch it out on a calculator. Besides, you can't remember the number of liters in a gallon. Punch in your price and currency rate here and all of your worries will evaporate.
